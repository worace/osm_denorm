* OSM Denormalize
Read OSM PBF or XML files and output denormalized geometries.
** Process
Pass 1: Read only Relations looking for multipolygon rels; build an index of way ids -> relations so that we can insert member ways into the correct spot on the second pass
Pass 2: Read nodes and ways
For ways:
 * a) way is member of a known multipolygon relation -- add it
   * a) there are still more ways in this rel -- continue
   * b) this is the final way in the multipoly -- output it
 * b) way is independent -- output it, either as polygon or linestring
** Handling Completed Multipolygons
 * If there are multiple ways with role "outer", need to combine them into a single linear ring
 * Then build a polygon with 1 outer and 0 or more inner rings (for geojson first ring is outer, all subsequent are inner)
